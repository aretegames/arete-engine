# Code of Conduct

_Adapted from the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct), [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md), and [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)._

## Conduct

* We pledge our commitment to providing an open, safe, and welcoming community for everyone. Everyone, from new developers to established members and professionals, should be comfortable and accepted regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other personal characteristics.
* Discrimination, harassment, and other forms of negative behavior are not tolerated in our community. This includes DMs or other private messages towards other members in our community.
* Spamming, trolling, and flaming are not welcome and will result in removal from our community.
* If you have been made to feel uncomfortable by other members, please report the conduct to our moderation team.
* If you have questions or concerns regarding our Code of Conduct, please reference the Citizen Code of Conduct for additional clarity. When in doubt, all interpretations and definitions follow this code of conduct, including those on harassment, expected behavior, and unacceptable behavior.
* Feedback is not only appreciated, but encouraged in our community, to our team, and about our engine. Remember, provide constructive feedback only - we are here to support one another not tear each other down. Conversely, receive feedback graciously and openly, assuming one anotherâ€™s best intent.
* Any retaliation for reporting Code of Conduct violations to the moderation team will result in immediate removal from our community.
* The Code of Conduct applies to all community platforms and forms of communication, including Discord.
* Above all, be a decent human being. Be kind, be courteous, and treat others with respect. We are here because of our shared passion for games, technology, and innovation. Let us all help, support, and uplift one another.

## Moderation

* Remarks that violate the Code of Conduct are prohibited.
* Offenders will first receive a warning from the moderation team for any of either seen or unseen, reported or unreported violations of our Code of Conduct.
* Ignored warnings will result in a temporary suspension from our community.
* After the temporary suspension, if the behavior persists, the offender will be banned indefinitely.
* Moderators, at their discretion, may ban permanently offenders who egregiously violate the Code of Conduct without issuing a temporary suspension first.
* Moderators, at their discretion, may unban or remove temporary suspensions. If you have been suspended or banned, please contact our moderation team in private if you believe the cause has been unjust, incorrect, or otherwise appealable. Complaints or appeals in public channels are not allowed. The offender must offer the offended party a genuine apology and clear and convincing reasoning and/or evidence for the undoing of a ban or temporary suspension.

## Reporting

* First, please DM our moderation/admin team in Discord.
* If you are uncomfortable using Discord when discussing issues with other community members or reporting a Code of Conduct violation, please contact our team directly:
  * Andrew (he/him): andrew@aretegames.io; Discord: andrewtonic
  * James (he/him): james@aretegames.io; Discord: James
