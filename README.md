# Arete Engine

## What is Arete?

Arete is a performance-first game engine. It intends to be a complete engine solution, from coding to rendering. It is particularly fast on unified-memory platforms -- that is, phones, VR headsets, many laptops, and consoles.

## Arete is in early development ðŸš§

Arete is not recommended for use in production. It is missing many features, and the features it does have will change.

Arete has not yet been officially released, and like many things, this page is under construction. Check back soon for more information!
