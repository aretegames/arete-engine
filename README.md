# Arete Engine

## What is Arete?

Arete Engine is a new type of unified-memory game engine. Arete is an ECS, Rust-based game engine with a focus on performance, optimization, and ergonomics. It intends to be a complete engine solution, from coding to rendering. It is particularly fast on unified-memory platforms -- that is, phones, VR headsets, many laptops, and consoles.

## Arete is in early development ðŸš§

Arete is an early stage engine. Currently, our engine consists primarily of a working unified-memory runtime. It is missing many features, and the features it does have will change. Please see our public roadmap below.
